I am a PhD student in the research group of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Eckehard Steinbach](https://www.ei.tum.de/en/lmt/team/staff/steinbach-eckehard/) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at TUM for both Bachelor and Master. From 2016 to 2018, I was a software engineer at the Objective Software GmbH and Luxoft Inc and worked in cooperation with the BMW Group in the area of Automotive and Autonomous Driving. In January 2019, I joined the [Chair of Media Technology](https://www.ei.tum.de/en/lmt/home/) at the Technical University of Munich as a research and teaching associate and PhD candidate.

My current [research](project/research) is focused on video processing, compression, and transmission of multi-camera systems for autonomous and teleoperated driving.
